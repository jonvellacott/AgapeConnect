{"body":"AgapeConnect is a Portal (based on DotNetNuke), which provides Ministries with tools to provide a Staff or Public Website. These tools include Staff Account Access, Online Reimbursements, Online Donations, News and Strories, a bookshop/resource centre and a Documents module. You can preview a demo of some of the AgapeConnect tools at [http://demo.agapeconnect.me/](http://demo.agapeconnect.me/). \r\n\r\nThis code has been developed by Campus Crusade for Christ International, primarily for our National Ministries to offer better (and cheaper) services to their Staff, Donors and Ministry Contacts. If you are interested in using this tool for your ministry please contact [info@agapeconnect.me](mailto:info@agapeconnect.me). If you are a CampusCrusade ministry, we can easily host your site. If you would prefer to install AgapeConnect on your own servers, we can help you with that too. \r\n\r\nOur team is very small, consisting of a handful of fulltime developers in the UK and France. We all work fulltime for Campus Crusade and our primary focus is on building tools that help our movement grow. If you are interested in joining our development team please contact us at info@agapeconnect.me. We are actively seeking the people with any of the following skills:\r\n* Programming\r\n* Project Management\r\n* Server and System Management\r\n* Design\r\n* A heart to serve the Lord.\r\n\r\nFor more information please contact: info@agapeconnect.me\r\n","name":"AgapeConnect","google":"","tagline":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
